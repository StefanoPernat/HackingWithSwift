# Hacking with Swift

My personal version of the code from "Hacking with Swift" by Paul Hudson

## Introduction

A simple introduction, overview of XCode and Swift programming language

## Project I: Storm Viewer

Learned the structure of a basic iOS App, designed UI through Interface Builder, basic constraints, used UIViewController and UITableViewController

## Project II: Guess the Flag

Practiced designing UI with interface builder, I learned about @2x, @3x images and using assets catalog. I Changed the look of a standard UIButton editing the CALayer underneath.
Used AlertController to show the score

#### Project II - Edits

I decided to update Paul Hudson's Project II displaying the score with a label and preventing the score to be negative, forcing a new game (reset score to 0)
